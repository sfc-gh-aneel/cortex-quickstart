# 🔗 Unified Data Orchestration for Retirement Plans

The ultimate AI interface that combines document AI, vector search, and structured data queries into one powerful retirement plan analytics platform!

## 🎯 What You'll Build

**Single API access** to all your retirement plan information:
- **📄 Document Intelligence**: Search plan documents, forms, compliance reports
- **💾 Structured Analytics**: Query participant data, balances, fund performance
- **🔍 Hybrid Search**: Combine document insights with data analytics
- **🤖 Multi-Model AI**: Leverage different AI models for optimal results
- **💬 Conversational Interface**: Natural language access to everything

## 🚀 Quick Demo (2 Minutes!)

### 1. Unified Query Interface

```sql
-- Ask anything about your retirement plan ecosystem
USE DATABASE RETIREMENT_PLAN_AI;
USE SCHEMA CORTEX_FUNCTIONS;

SELECT UNIFIED_RETIREMENT_QUERY(
    'Find participants over 55 with low account balances and show relevant guidance from our plan documents'
) AS comprehensive_analysis;
```

### 2. Cross-Source Intelligence

```sql
-- Combine document search with participant data
SELECT HYBRID_SEARCH_AND_ANALYZE(
    'What does our SPD say about vesting schedules and how does this apply to our current participants?'
) AS policy_analysis;
```

### 3. Executive Intelligence Dashboard

```sql
-- Single query for complete plan overview
SELECT EXECUTIVE_DASHBOARD_QUERY(
    'Give me a complete overview of plan health: participation rates, document compliance, fund performance, and risk areas'
) AS executive_briefing;
```

## 🏗️ Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Deploy Unified Platform

```sql
-- Execute this in your Snowflake worksheet
-- Requires all previous templates to be set up first
@orchestration/setup.sql
```

### Step 2: Test Unified Access

```sql
-- Test cross-source querying
SELECT * FROM TABLE(UNIFIED_SEARCH('contribution limits and participant data'));

-- Test multi-modal analysis
SELECT ANALYZE_WITH_CONTEXT(
    'compliance issues',
    JSON_PARSE('{"include_documents": true, "include_participant_data": true}')
) AS analysis;
```

### Step 3: Configure Executive Dashboards

```sql
-- Set up automated executive reporting
CALL CONFIGURE_EXECUTIVE_DASHBOARDS('[YOUR_EXECUTIVE_EMAIL]');

-- Generate first executive briefing
SELECT GENERATE_EXECUTIVE_BRIEFING('weekly') AS briefing;
```

## 🎪 Demo Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Unified Compliance Analysis
**Use Case**: Complete compliance review combining policy documents and participant data

```sql
-- Comprehensive compliance check
SELECT UNIFIED_COMPLIANCE_ANALYSIS(
    'Analyze our current compliance status including document requirements, participant distributions, and regulatory deadlines'
) AS compliance_report;

-- Specific compliance deep-dive
SELECT HYBRID_COMPLIANCE_QUERY(
    'Find participants approaching age 72 and review our SPD requirements for required minimum distributions'
) AS rmd_analysis;
```

### Scenario 2: Investment Committee Preparation
**Use Case**: Complete investment review with fund data, participant behavior, and policy documents

```sql
-- Full investment committee briefing
SELECT INVESTMENT_COMMITTEE_BRIEFING(
    'Prepare a comprehensive investment review including fund performance, participant allocation trends, and investment policy compliance'
) AS committee_report;

-- Fund-specific analysis with policy context
SELECT ANALYZE_FUND_WITH_POLICY(
    'FUND001',  -- Target Date 2060 Fund
    'Review this fund''s performance against our investment policy guidelines'
) AS fund_analysis;
```

### Scenario 3: Participant Experience Enhancement
**Use Case**: Improve participant outcomes by combining behavioral data with educational content

```sql
-- Identify improvement opportunities
SELECT PARTICIPANT_EXPERIENCE_ANALYSIS(
    'Find participants with suboptimal investment choices and identify relevant educational materials from our document library'
) AS experience_insights;

-- Personalized participant guidance
SELECT GENERATE_PARTICIPANT_GUIDANCE(
    'PART001',
    'Create personalized retirement guidance based on their current situation and relevant plan documents'
) AS personalized_advice;
```

### Scenario 4: Regulatory Audit Preparation
**Use Case**: Complete audit readiness combining all data sources

```sql
-- Audit readiness assessment
SELECT AUDIT_READINESS_CHECK(
    'Prepare for DOL audit: verify document compliance, test calculations, and identify any potential issues'
) AS audit_preparation;

-- Specific regulatory requirement check
SELECT REGULATORY_REQUIREMENT_ANALYSIS(

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Problem**: Queries return inconsistent results across data sources
**Solution**: 
```sql
-- Implement data consistency checks
CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE VALIDATE_DATA_CONSISTENCY()
RETURNS STRING
LANGUAGE SQL
AS
$$
DECLARE
    issues_found TEXT DEFAULT '';
BEGIN
    -- Check participant count consistency
    WITH participant_counts AS (
        SELECT 
            (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM PARTICIPANT_DATA.PARTICIPANTS) AS structured_count,
            (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT PARTICIPANT_ID) FROM PARTICIPANT_EMBEDDINGS) AS embedding_count
    )
    SELECT CASE 
        WHEN structured_count != embedding_count THEN 
            'ISSUE: Participant count mismatch - Structured: ' || structured_count || ', Embeddings: ' || embedding_count
        ELSE 'OK: Participant counts match'
    END INTO issues_found
    FROM participant_counts;
    
    RETURN issues_found;
END;
$$;
```

**Problem**: Complex queries taking too long
**Solution**: 
```sql
-- Implement intelligent query caching
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS QUERY_CACHE (
    query_hash VARCHAR(64) PRIMARY KEY,
    query_text TEXT,
    result_data TEXT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP(),
    expires_at TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION CACHED_UNIFIED_QUERY(query_text TEXT)
RETURNS TEXT
LANGUAGE SQL
AS
$$
WITH cached_result AS (
    SELECT result_data 
    FROM QUERY_CACHE 
    WHERE query_hash = SHA2(query_text)
    AND expires_at > CURRENT_TIMESTAMP()
)
SELECT COALESCE(
    (SELECT result_data FROM cached_result),
    (SELECT UNIFIED_RETIREMENT_QUERY(query_text))  -- Execute if not cached
)
$$;
```

## 🎉 Next Steps

1. **Deploy MCP Integration**: Advanced AI agent workflows → `../mcp-server-integration/`
2. **Build Custom Applications**: Use unified API in external apps
3. **Scale to Production**: Optimize for enterprise workloads
4. **Add Real-Time Feeds**: Connect live data streams
