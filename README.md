# 🚀 Snowflake Cortex AI Innovation Lab

Welcome to your comprehensive testing ground for **Snowflake Cortex** - the cutting-edge AI and ML platform that's revolutionizing how we work with data! This repository contains ready-to-use templates, examples, and guides to help you quickly explore and demonstrate the most exciting AI features in Snowflake.

## 🎯 What You'll Build & Test

This repository covers **6 game-changing AI capabilities** that will transform how your organization works with data:

| 🧠 Feature Area | 🎪 What You'll Demo | 🔥 Why It's Exciting |
|-----------------|---------------------|----------------------|
| **📄 Text Extraction & Chunking** | Extract insights from PDFs, emails, complex documents | Turn any document into actionable data with AI |
| **🔢 Vector Embedding** | Transform text into searchable vectors with multiple models | Make your data semantically searchable |
| **🔍 Vector Search Retrieval** | Hybrid search combining similarity and keywords | Find exactly what you need, even when you don't know what to search for |
| **💬 Structured Data Processing** | Natural language conversations with your databases | Ask questions in plain English, get SQL answers |
| **🔗 Data Orchestration** | Unified API for structured + unstructured data | One interface to rule all your data sources |
| **🤖 MCP Server Integration** | Model Context Protocol for advanced AI workflows | Next-generation AI agent capabilities |

## 🚀 Quick Start (5 Minutes to AI Magic!)

### Prerequisites
- **Snowflake Trial Account** (get one free at [trial.snowflake.com](https://trial.snowflake.com))
- **ACCOUNTADMIN** role access
- Basic SQL knowledge (we'll guide you through the rest!)

### 🎬 Choose Your Adventure

Pick any feature that excites you most - each template is self-contained and ready to run:

```bash
# 1. 📄 Start with Document AI (Great for demos!)
cd text-extraction-chunking/
# Follow the README to process your first PDF in minutes

# 2. 🔍 Try Semantic Search (Mind-blowing for end users!)
cd vector-search-retrieval/
# Build Google-like search for your company data

# 3. 💬 Talk to Your Database (The crowd pleaser!)
cd structured-data-processing/
# Ask questions in English, get insights instantly

# 4. 🔗 Connect Everything (The enterprise wow factor!)
cd orchestration/
# Single API for all your data sources
```

## 🔧 Initial Setup

1. **Clone and Configure**
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd cortex-quickstart
   cp setup/config.template.sql setup/config.sql
   # Edit config.sql with your Snowflake details
   ```

2. **Run Setup Script**
   ```sql
   -- Execute setup/initial-setup.sql in your Snowflake worksheet
   -- This creates databases, schemas, and enables Cortex features
   ```

3. **Choose Your First Demo**
   - **New to AI?** → Start with `text-extraction-chunking/`
   - **Want to impress stakeholders?** → Jump to `structured-data-processing/`
   - **Building a product?** → Explore `orchestration/`

## 🎨 Customization Made Easy

Every template includes:
- ✅ **Clear placeholders** (search for `[YOUR_*]` to customize)
- ✅ **Sample data** (works immediately in trial accounts)
- ✅ **Scaling guides** (from prototype to production)
- ✅ **Error troubleshooting** (common issues and fixes)

## 🔥 Pro Tips for Maximum Impact

1. **Start with sample data** - Each template includes realistic test datasets
2. **Demo the "wow moments"** - Every README highlights the most impressive features
3. **Combine features** - The real magic happens when you chain multiple Cortex capabilities
4. **Scale gradually** - Templates show both proof-of-concept and production patterns
