Welcome to your comprehensive testing ground for **Snowflake Cortex** - the cutting-edge AI and ML platform that's revolutionizing how we work with data! This repository contains ready-to-use templates, examples, and guides to help you quickly explore and demonstrate the most exciting AI features in Snowflake.

## 🎯 What You'll Build & Test

This repository covers **6 game-changing AI capabilities** that will transform how your organization works with data:

| 🧠 Feature Area | 🎪 What You'll Demo | 🔥 Why It's Exciting |
|-----------------|---------------------|----------------------|
| **📄 Text Extraction & Chunking** | Extract insights from PDFs, emails, complex documents | Turn any document into actionable data with AI |
| **🔢 Vector Embedding** | Transform text into searchable vectors with multiple models | Make your data semantically searchable |
| **🔍 Vector Search Retrieval** | Hybrid search combining similarity and keywords | Find exactly what you need, even when you don't know what to search for |
| **💬 Structured Data Processing** | Natural language conversations with your databases | Ask questions in plain English, get SQL answers |
| **🔗 Data Orchestration** | Unified API for structured + unstructured data | One interface to rule all your data sources |
| **🤖 MCP Server Integration** | Model Context Protocol for advanced AI workflows | Next-generation AI agent capabilities |

## 🚀 Quick Start (5 Minutes to AI Magic!)

### Prerequisites
- **Snowflake Trial Account** (get one free at [trial.snowflake.com](https://trial.snowflake.com))
- **ACCOUNTADMIN** role access
- Basic SQL knowledge (we'll guide you through the rest!)

### 🎬 Recommended Learning Path

Follow the execution order below or jump to [QUICKSTART.md](QUICKSTART.md) for immediate results:

```bash
# Step 1: Foundation (Required)
cd setup/
# Run initial-setup.sql then load-sample-data.sql

# Step 2: Document Processing (Start here for AI features)
cd text-extraction-chunking/
# Process PDFs and documents with AI

# Step 3: Vector Intelligence  
cd vector-embedding/
# Create semantic embeddings for search

# Step 4: Natural Language Interface
cd structured-data-processing/
# Ask questions in plain English

# Step 5: Unified Power (The enterprise wow factor!)
cd orchestration/
# Single API combining all AI capabilities
```

## 🔧 Initial Setup

1. **Configure Your Environment**
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd cortex-quickstart
   # Edit setup/config.template.sql with your Snowflake account details
   ```

2. **Deploy Foundation**
   ```sql
   -- Execute in your Snowflake worksheet:
   @setup/initial-setup.sql
   @setup/load-sample-data.sql
   ```

3. **Verify Installation**
   ```sql
   -- Quick verification:
   SELECT * FROM RETIREMENT_PLAN_AI.ANALYTICS.PARTICIPANT_OVERVIEW LIMIT 5;
   ```

## 🎨 Customization Made Easy

Every template includes:
- ✅ **Clear placeholders** (search for `[YOUR_*]` to customize)
- ✅ **Sample data** (works immediately in trial accounts)
- ✅ **Scaling guides** (from prototype to production)
- ✅ **Error troubleshooting** (common issues and fixes)

## 🔥 Pro Tips for Maximum Impact

1. **Start with sample data** - Each template includes realistic test datasets
2. **Demo the "wow moments"** - Every README highlights the most impressive features
3. **Combine features** - The real magic happens when you chain multiple Cortex capabilities
4. **Scale gradually** - Templates show both proof-of-concept and production patterns

## 📋 Execution Order

Follow this sequence for optimal learning and demonstration:

### 🥇 **Start Here**: Foundation Setup
1. **[Setup](setup/)** - Run initial database and warehouse setup
2. **[Load Sample Data](setup/load-sample-data.sql)** - Populate with realistic retirement plan data

### 🥈 **Core AI Features** (Build in this order)
3. **[Text Extraction & Chunking](text-extraction-chunking/)** - Process documents first (provides data for other features)
4. **[Vector Embedding](vector-embedding/)** - Create embeddings (requires chunked text from step 3)
5. **[Structured Data Processing](structured-data-processing/)** - Natural language queries (independent)

### 🥉 **Advanced Integration** 
6. **[Vector Search Retrieval](vector-search-retrieval/)** - Hybrid search (requires embeddings from step 4)
7. **[Orchestration](orchestration/)** - Unified interface (requires all previous steps)
8. **[MCP Server Integration](mcp-server-integration/)** - Advanced workflows (optional)

### 🎯 **Demo Ready!**
